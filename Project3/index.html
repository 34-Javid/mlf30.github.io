                Leonardo da Vinci (1452 – 1519) is one of the world’s greatest thinkers, artists and philosophers. Seeking after perfection, he created rare masterpieces of art such as ‘The Mona Lisa’ and The Last Supper.’          
             
                In addition to art, Da Vinci studied all aspects of life from anatomy to mathematics and astronomy; his far-reaching investigations and discoveries sought to show an underlying unity of the universe. Da Vinci is considered to be a key person in the birth of the European Renaissance, which saw an emergence of new ideas, scientific discoveries and the creation of beautiful art.
                Leonardo was born an illegitimate son of a Florentine noble and peasant woman; he grew up in Vinci, Italy. In his formative years, he developed a love of nature and from an early age began to display his remarkable academic and artistic talents.

                    In 1499, his patron L. Sforza was defeated by the French invasion, causing Leonardo to return to Florence. During this period, he painted the fresco of the Battle of Anghiari. This artwork was to exert tremendous influence over future artists. However, it was never completed and was later destroyed. It was also during this period that Leonardo completed The Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is one of the world’s most famous and intriguing pictures. The Mona Lisa is a portrait of a wife of a Florentine noble. For several days she came to Leonardo and sat for her portrait to be painted; however, she refused to smile. Leonardo even tried hiring musicians but to no avail. One day, just for a fleeting second, she gave a faint smile, and Leonardo was able to capture it. Her smile encapsulates a mysteriousness which is both fascinating and intriguing. Sri Chinmoy said of the Mona Lisa.

            <p class="reading">
                Raphael was born in 1483, in the city of Urbino, in the Marches area of Italy. His father was a court painter and Raphael followed in his father’s footsteps, helping with his father’s own work at the court. He also gained a wide education in the arts, literature and social skills. When he was 11 years old, he was orphaned and his formal guardian became Bartolomeo, a priest  Around 1500, aged 17, he was apprenticed to the workshop of the painter, Pietro Perugino. Raphael was adept in learning new painting techniques and his wonderful technical capacity meant he could soon replicate the paintings of his master. His reputation for being a talented artist quickly spread.                
                 By 1501, Raphael was held in high esteem and he gained important commissions, such as the Mond de Crucifixion in 1503. From about 1504, Raphael lived mainly in Florence, which was a burgeoning centre of the Renaissance. He became acquainted with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. (whom he fell out with on numerous occasions) He was inspired by their art and was quick to learn any new techniques and styles. For example, he often imitated Da Vinci’s style of painting figures in the formation of triangles.
                 Raphael became the pre-eminent painter in the Court of Medici, but in 1508, Pope Julius II summoned Raphael to the Vatican and gave him important commissions. Pope Julius II wished to see an artistic revival and recreate the prestige of ancient Rome. It was a fortuitous combination – the Pope’s patronage and the high Renaissance artists, such as Raphael. The pope asked Raphael to decorate a room in his residence with frescos. The pope was so impressed with Raphael’s work that he had other frescos removed so that he could have more space for Raphael.
